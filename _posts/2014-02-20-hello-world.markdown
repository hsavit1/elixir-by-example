You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule Hello do
  IO.puts "Defining the function world"

  def world do
    IO.puts "Hello World"
  end

  IO.puts "Function world defined"
end

Hello.world
{% endhighlight %}
